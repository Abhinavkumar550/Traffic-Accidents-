# Traffic-Accidents-
# 🚧 Traffic Accident Severity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes traffic accident data to predict whether a crash will result in a **Severe** or **Non-Severe** injury based on conditions like weather, lighting, and primary cause.

## 📊 Project Overview

- 📁 Dataset: Real-world traffic accident data
- 🎯 Goal: Predict injury severity using machine learning models
- 📌 Classification Type: Binary (Severe / Non-Severe)

---

## 🔍 Features Used

- `prim_contributory_cause`
- `weather_condition`
- `lighting_condition`

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

| Model                | Accuracy (%) |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression  | ~XX%         |
| Decision Tree        | ~XX%         |
| Random Forest        | ~XX%         |
| K-Nearest Neighbors  | ~XX%         |

> Replace the `XX` with your actual results from the accuracy chart.
