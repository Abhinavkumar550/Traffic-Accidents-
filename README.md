# Traffic-Accidents-
# 🚧 Traffic Accident Severity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes traffic accident data to predict whether a crash will result in a **Severe** or **Non-Severe** injury based on conditions like weather, lighting, and primary cause.

## 📊 Project Overview

- 📁 Dataset: Real-world traffic accident data
- 🎯 Goal: Predict injury severity using machine learning models
- 📌 Classification Type: Binary (Severe / Non-Severe)
